# Testing In Context
Software tests can be grouped into two broad global categories:

    Functional tests
    Non-functional tests

### Functional tests
Functional tests refer to tests that prove that the software does what it was designed to do.
- **Unit tests**: testing the basic units in which the software is organized, working in isolation.
- **Integration tests**: testing sets of basic units that are related to each other, to verify that their relationships work correctly.
-** Acceptance tests**: testing the entry and exit points of the software to verify that its behavior is as defined by the stakeholders.
- **Regression tests**: these are tests that can detect the consequences of changes we may have made in the software that lead to undesired behavior.
- **Characterization tests**: these are tests that are written when the software does not have other tests and are usually created by running the software under certain conditions and observing the results.

**Test Driven Development** can also be practiced at all three levels. The idea is that tests are defined first and the code is written for the tests to pass. Once this is achieved, after eliminating possible redundancies, the written tests are automatically converted into regression tests.

### Non-functional tests
**Non-functional tests** refer to how the software works. Apart from providing functionality, it is necessary that the software offers reliability, responsiveness, etc., something that is transversal to all types of applications and that can be measured in different ways. These tests test things such as, among others:
